| {{< td-colspan 2 >}}**Mary Rowlandson**{{< /td-colspan >}} ||
| Rowlandson, Mary. [_The Narrative of the Captivity and Restoration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson_](http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/lookup?num=851). | Compilation of downloadable texts from various sources. |
| Henwood, Dawn. "Mary Rowlandson and the Psalms: The Textuality of Survival." _Early American Literature_ 32, no. 2 (1997): 169-186. | &nbsp; |
| Woodard, Maureen L. "Female Captivity and the Deployment of Race in Three Early American Texts." _Papers on Language & Literature_ 32, no. 2 (Spring 1996): 115-121. | Abstract: "Focusing mostly on female victims, captivity stories in early US literature addressed the fears of colonists who felt threatened by the power of the wilderness and its indigenous population. Woodard examines how three works by Mary Rowlandson, Susanna Rowson and Charles Brockden Brown invoke the images of female entrapment and transformation." |
| Fitzpatrick, Tara. "The Figure of Captivity: The Cultural Work of the Puritan Captivity Narrative." _American Literary History_ 3, no. 1 (Spring 1991): 1-26. | &nbsp; |
| Potter, Tiffany. "Writing Indigenous Femininity: Mary Rowlandson's Narrative of Captivity." _Eighteenth-Century Studies_ 36, no. 2 (Winter 2003): 153-168. | Abstract: "Mary Rowlandson's narrative of her captivity offers insight into the ideas of femininity and race in early colonial America through its depiction of Weetamoo, the squaw-sachem of the Wampanoags. Despite evidence that Weetamoo was quite well known as an enemy in King Philip's War, Rowlandson refuses to acknowledge Weetamoo's extraordinary status and power in her own culture. Instead, Rowlandson attempts to cast Weetamoo merely as a failure of the Eurocentric femininity articulated by Increase Mather in his Preface to the text-a femininity that Rowlandson works so hard to claim for herself in her representation of her own maternity, asexuality, and gender-appropriate production and exchange." |
| {{< td-colspan 2 >}}**Lydia Maria Child**{{< /td-colspan >}} ||
| Petitjean, Tom "Child's Hobomok." _The Explicator_ 53, no. 3 (Spring 1995): 145-147. | A brief consideration of Child's treatment of mysticism, race, and gender in _Hobomok_. |
| Cox, James H. "The Power of Sympathy: European American Women Novelists Imagine Indigenous Absence." _American Transcendental Quarterly_ 15, no. 3 (Sep 2001): 191-208. | Abstract: "Cox illustrates how colonial plots constructed by men and women frequently diverge and, then, clearly reconverge to culminate in Native American absence. The consistent creation of Indians by women and men in order to author them into absence suggests there are narrative or imaginative limitations to sympathy as a mode of resistance to colonialism." |
